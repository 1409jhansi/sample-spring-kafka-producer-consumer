# To run the project first start up the Kafka cluster

Assuming you are in the Kafka home folder, you can use the following set of commands to start a local kafka cluster

## Start Zookeeper
[source, java]
----
bin/zookeeper-server-start.sh config/zookeeper.properties
----

## Start Kafka broker:
[source, java]
----
bin/kafka-server-start.sh config/server.properties
----

# Start up the Producer, from the root of the project

[source, java]
----
cd sample-spring-kafka-producer
../gradlew bootRun
----

# Start up the Consumer

[source, java]
----
cd sample-spring-kafka-consumer
../gradlew bootRun
----


## At this point some sample messages can be generated using this endpoint:

http://localhost:8080/generateWork?id=1&definition=test

The producer should print a message on the console that the Work unit has been dispatched and the consumer should receive and process the Work unit
